# PRACTICAL WORK II

Hugo Prieto Petrossi - Practical Work II - FCE - EPS - UFV - 2024/2025

## Description

The following project is an HTML and CSS website in which you can find information about me, including a CV and some social links; a breakdown of what the double degree I am studying consists of, with a closer look to the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject; a compilation of the basic concepts about playing the piano, concepts which I have learnt during the past two weeks as I have started to learn to play it; links to some of my classmates webs, and a simple contact form.

## Process

### 1. Project Initiation (From 1st Push to 2nd Push)

- Finished the initial project structure including: files and folder structure, README headings & .gitignore configuration (executed first push because of index.html creation).
- Started the HTML structure of index page, including the navbar with UFV logo. Added basic styles and the styles of the navbar to the styles file.
- Created the footer and styled it.
- Created all content inside the main tag in index.html and styled it.

### 2. Creating and styling about.html

- Created about.html (executed second push because of about.html creation).
- Included basic structure, header and footer for the about page.
- Created all content inside the main tag in about.html and styled it.

### 3. Creating and styling degree.html

- Created degree.html (executed third push because of degree.html creation).
- Included basic structure, header and footer for the degree page.
- Created all content inside the main tag in degree.html and styled it.
- Modyfing the highlighted element of the navbar in degree page.

### 4. Creating and styling fce.html

- Created fce.html (executed fourth push because of fce.html creation).
- Included basic structure, header and footer, and all content inside main tag and its styles for the FCE page.

### 5. Creating and styling topic.html

- Corrected typo in readme first line of <<4. Creating and styling fce.html>>
- Created topic.html (executed third push because of topic.html creation).
- Included basic structure, header and footer for the topic page.
- Corrected structure for it to be of the topic page and not of the fce page.
- Created all content inside the main tag in about.html and styled it.
- Corrected readme.md, added description and problems.

## Problems

As for the programming part, it was a bit of a problem to code the piano from topic.html using flexbox, it required a bit of creativity. I had no more problems regarding the programming part. However, I did have a problem with the git part. As I didn't understand correctly the 6 pushes instruction, I had to repeat the work again, because in stead of performing just a push for each page, I started by making a push every time I created a page and then pushes as the development went on, which lead to far more than 6 pushes being done. This error forced me to repeat the whole project, except for the code, which I had already written.

## Conclusions
